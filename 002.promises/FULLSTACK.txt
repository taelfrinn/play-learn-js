A single programming language and environment across all layers of the "stack":

web                    web service              back-end service        database
browser
----------          ---------------          --------------------- -----------
angular                 node                     node                    plv8


this lowers the barrier to entry for swarming to different parts of the system


Asynchronous development style: the non-blocking style of logic allows for easier scaling of
logic, and a very low overhead for parallellism, and fewer delays caused by blocking dependancies.
(i.e. a hung DNS lookup wont block logic that does not depend upon it)

This also allows the complex dependencies and edge cases introduced by threading to be avoided.
